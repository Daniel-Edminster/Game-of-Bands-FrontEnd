Batman really know?s how to throw a party. The bat booze was flowing and the bat cave was bumpin?. A far better vibe than the last one we did for superman. I mean seriously.... The fortress of solitude? What kind of place for a party is that?\r\n\r\nI was a young MC fresh off the streets\r\nWith a hot best selling brand new EP\r\nWhen I was invited out to play a private show\r\nIn a mansion on a hill down a dark spooky road\r\nIt was the after party, to the annual convention\r\nof the American society of psychic crime prevention\r\nAnd as I rolled up, a storm rolled in\r\nI shook off the rain and got the place bumpin?\r\nI was hot on the mic ?til lightning struck the house\r\nand I took 10,000 volts right in the mouth\r\nIt knocked me out and I should have been dead\r\nBut when I came to I had a voice in my head\r\nA guiding soul with wisdom not bound by time\r\nThat would lend me it?s voice when I spoke in rhymes\r\nSo I took to the streets and started fighting crime\r\nMC Marvel brings justice with the bump and grind\r\n\r\nMy flow?s hotter than the human torch\r\nI deliver lines faster than the flash\r\nThe hulk?s got nothing on these smash hits\r\nMC Marvel on the mic\r\n\r\nWith my mask, cape and boombox in tow\r\naccompanied by my sidekick DJ Supro\r\nI reveal the future with my lyrical prose\r\nWith important info in every slick flow\r\nI deliver rhymes when danger?s coming\r\nso If I drop the beat you better be running\r\nMy delivery is steady and powerful\r\nBut my powers aren?t completely infallible\r\nThey only work as I deliver rhymes\r\nSo even with all the warning signs\r\nIt?s still kinda hard to find just the right lines\r\nThat would save a person?s life in time\r\nSometime I just want to shout, ?duck!?\r\nBut I have to make it rhyme and I might get stuck\r\nSo I don?t rack my brain for a perfect phrase\r\nI use, ?Move! citizen get out the way?\r\nI?m generically trying to save your life today\r\nAnd specifically keep you away from a train\r\nIt?s a little clumsy, that I?ll cede\r\nBut lyricism is less important when there?s immediate need\r\n\r\nI?m keepin? it flyer than Superman\r\nI?m friendlier than your hood?s Spider-Man\r\nStorm?s not the only one that?ll make it rain\r\nMC Marvel on the mic\r\n\r\nI stopped all the crime, the whole city was chillin?\r\nWhen a dejected producer became a supervillain\r\nHe met the piped piper, sampled some beats\r\nAnd now inner city youth do all his dirty deeds\r\nIt?s like a war being waged out in the streets\r\nIt keeps this super hero super busy\r\nAnd he?s never seen at the scene of his crimes\r\nSo it?s hard to get him serving hard time\r\nCause there?s laws against copyright infringement\r\nBut nothing stopping him from remixing\r\nhits song with hypnotic intentions\r\nAnd en?rin? radio remix competitions\r\nIt?s too hot to handle for the police commission\r\nParents are left worrying and wishin?\r\nFor a halt to all the rogue transmissions\r\n?fore the city needs a music prohibition\r\nSo I?m using my psychic premonitions\r\nTo make it safe for children and musicians\r\nTune in each week with your parents permission\r\nTo join MC Marvel on his crime fightin? mission.\r\n\r\nStan Lee wishes he could write like this\r\nFrom Gotham to Metropolis\r\nI?m keeping it safe for all the party people\r\nMC Marvel on the mic\r\n\r\n\"There must be something rotten in Denmark, Cause this beat is

cast aside,\r\nafter all this time still traumatized, a glaze forming over my eyes\r\nit?s been 4 long cycles of 365, since my heart rate last did rise,\r\nsince I saw those big blue eyes, that spotlight smile, that beautiful mind.\r\nNow all I see is this face of mine, In this bathroom mirror that I despise\r\nA face once happy and full of life, now old and sad and wrinkled by strife.\r\n\r\nI still remember like it?s yesterday, I let the words fly and I drove her away\r\nI tried to repent, but it was far too late, so I tacked on a smile and left for the day\r\nI knew what I?d done, and it tore me apart, I?d aimed those words like darts straight at her heart.\r\nI sat at my desk, tapped out a text and hit send, she shot back in seconds ?this is the end.?\r\nI dialed her seven digits, she told me where I could stick it. She?d declared war, and she was out to win it.\r\n\r\nGet called into a meeting and my phone gets to shaking. It?s her on the line and there?s no way i?m gonna take it.\r\nNot 5 minutes later and it?s buzzing once more, but she said she wanted battle, so I swipe to ignore.\r\n30 minutes later and it rings again, and I wish now that I had answered, but that?s not how this ends.\r\nThe hours fly by; i?m out the door headed home, and when I get to my car, I take a peek at my phone.\r\n3 missed calls, 3 voicemail alerts. I get ready for the dressing down I know I deserved.\r\n\r\nHit play on the first, and it?s something unexpected, the voice on the phone has fear in the inflection.\r\n?There?s a man on the street, and he?s sticking close to me. \r\nHe keeps getting closer and he thinks that I don?t see. \r\nYou were supposed to come meet me and take me home, \r\nbut when you didn?t show up I started walking alone. \r\nI hope you get his very quickly, please answer your phone?\r\n\r\nShaken and scared, I hit play on the next, and the words that come out hit me right in the chest.\r\n?Babe, i?m freaking out, he?s still following me. There?s nobody around, so I called the police.\r\nThey said that they could send someone out in an hour, but I really need someone to come right now.\r\nI know I said some things, and I really regret ?em, but you have to understand I was really upset and?\r\nI really need you right now, come help me please?? Her sentence was interrupted by a terrified scream. \r\n?Please leave me alone, I just wanna get home, I can give you money, take my wallet and phone!? \r\nI hear the sounds of running and the sounds of a struggle, and her terrified screams to let me know she?s in trouble.\r\nThen it?s just heavy breathing, and his words, best left unsaid. After 20 more seconds, the line goes dead. \r\n\r\nI play the final voicemail, and I don?t know what I expected, but her voice on the line is surprisingly collected.\r\nShe tells me she loves me and it?s not my fault, but I know i should?ve drove her and she should not have walked.\r\nShe tells me she?s cold and she wishes I was with her, to hold her for last breaths, to squeeze her hand and kiss her.\r\nShe tells me how she?s not really ready to die, and she?s afraid of what?s waiting on the other side. \r\nI can hear her last breaths, her accepting her death, then I hear sirens in the distance and I have to disconnect.","round":"32","votes":"2","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":"0","musicvote":"3","lyricsvote":"2","vocalsvote":"6","teamnumber":"6","submitby":"","approved":"1","posted":"1","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":"0","streamurl":null},{"id":"235","name":"Hey You","url":"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/tgpo\/hey-you","music":"tgpo","lyrics":"Hi_mynameis_Matt","vocals":"donttouchthatknob","lyricsheet":"HEY!\r\nHEY!\r\nHEY!\r\nHEY you\r\nAre not the one we fighted for\r\nWe gave you power and now you\r\ntell us that you want more\r\nWell you can take these orders\r\nAnd shove them up your ass\r\nA greedy dictatorship\r\nMakes us all come in last\r\nHEY!\r\nHEY!\r\nHEY!\r\nHEY you\r\nIn your ivory towers\r\nHave you paid the price?\r\nYou'll find the cost of business\r\nIs more than just dollar signs\r\nAll hail the almighty dollar\r\nAll the rest is cannon fodder\r\nWhat of the shoulders you stand on?\r\nDo you take credit for their height?\r\nHEY HEY HEY HEY\r\nThis is not a revolution\r\nIt's just the start of one\r\nAll it takes is one rogue spark\r\nAnd a bullet from a gun\r\nThis is not a revolution\r\nIt's just the start of one\r\nAll it takes is one rogue spark\r\nAnd a bullet from a gun\r\nThis is not a revolution\r\nIt's just the start of one\r\nAll it takes is one rogue spark\r\nAnd a bullet from a gun\r\nHEY\r\nHEY\r\nHEY\r\nHEY","round":"33","votes":"7","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":"0","musicvote":"7","lyricsvote":"7","vocalsvote":"8","teamnumber":"4","submitby":"tgpo","approved":"1","posted":"1","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":"0","streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/122648364\/stream"},{"id":"239","name":"Punk as Funk","url":"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/jamesnarey\/punk-as-funk-game-of-bands","music":"Kasminova","lyrics":"Scottpontiac","vocals":"Kasminova","lyricsheet":"PUNK AS FUNK\r\n\r\nVERSE(Funk)\r\nI'm a working class zero\r\nJust a tube-watching boob\r\nAn office antihero \r\nWho clicks a mouse in a cube\r\nI dream of a weekend\r\nWhere I can be free\r\nI can't comprehend \r\nHow I just stay here and dream\r\nAnd as I drink my coffee\r\nThink of how my life's stunk\r\nit can't go more awfully\r\nSo I'll be punk as funk\r\n\r\nCHORUS (punk)\r\nThis weekend I'm a warrior\r\nI'm punk as funk\r\nI'll write a new life story\r\nYeah I'm punk as funk\r\nI'll do it all so different\r\nCause I'm punk as funk\r\nThey'll say \"Oh no you didn't!\"\r\nYeah I'm punk as funk\r\nYou'll see me get so insane\r\nmore than anyone thunk\r\nNo longer I'm constrained,\r\nYeah I'll be punk as funk\r\n\r\nSolo(?)\r\n\r\nVERSE(funk)\r\nNow I am back in the office\r\nNo one knows what I did\r\nI have to be cautious\r\nWhen I'm back on the grid\r\nIf anyone finds out\r\nI could lose my crap job\r\nand now I'm riddled with doubt\r\nHow can I be such a knob\r\nAnd as I sit in the break room\r\nAnd see how low I have sunk\r\nI know my old life is doomed\r\nAnd now I'm punk as funk.\r\n\r\nCHORUS (punk)\r\nThis weekend I'm a warrior\r\nI'm punk as funk\r\nI'll write a new life story\r\nYeah I'm punk as funk\r\nI'll do it all so different\r\nCause I'm punk as funk\r\nThey'll say \"Oh no you didn't!\"\r\nYeah I'm punk as funk\r\nYou'll see me get so insane\r\nmore than anyone thunk\r\nNo longer I'm constrained,\r\nYeah I'll be punk as funk","round":"33","votes":"5","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":"0","musicvote":"4","lyricsvote":"6","vocalsvote":"4","teamnumber":"7","submitby":"kasminova","approved":"1","posted":"1","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":"0","streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/122766160\/stream"},{"id":"241","name":"End Of The Girled","url":"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/danremmick\/end-of-the-girled","music":"IAmTriumph","lyrics":"Brewbird","vocals":"IAmDanMarshall","lyricsheet":"In the year 2074 mankind's international tensions finally matched his inward self-hatred and a cataclysm rocked the human population.

fun\r\nBut we all had to do what had to be done\r\n-ZOMBIE-\r\nGonna keep coming until we eat all your brains\r\nWe're coming wave after wave, again and again\r\n-HUMAN-\r\nThe 3rd Wave started and I got really scared\r\nA Zombie got so close that he bit off my chest hair!\r\nThe 4th Wave came along and knocked us back\r\nNot sure how we can - survive these attacks\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nIt's a Zombie \r\nZombie Attack!\r\nIt's a Zombie \r\nZombie Attack!\r\nWhy'd I stay behind?\r\nI should have fled!\r\nNow I'm on the front lines\r\nAgainst the undead!\r\n\r\nSECOND SET OF ATTACKS\r\n-HUMAN-\r\nThe fifth wave of zombies set us back a good deal\r\nTHey got Steve and Shirley and they made them their meal\r\nThe sixth round they piled up and came over the wall\r\nThe human army is getting eaten and mauled\r\n-ZOMBIE-\r\nIt's your fault for making  toxic waste\r\nWe really want to eat you because we do love the taste\r\n-HUMAN-\r\nThe 7th wave started and they bit off my arm \r\nI kept on fighting I'm not buying the farm\r\nThe 8th round they blew right threw and opened the gates\r\nThis could be the end we're in dire straights\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nIt's a Zombie \r\nZombie Attack!\r\nIt's a Zombie \r\nZombie Attack!\r\nWhy'd I stay behind?\r\nI should have fled!\r\nNow I'm on the front lines\r\nAgainst the undead!\r\n\r\nFINAL ROUND\r\n-HUMAN-\r\nThe ninth wave they overcame and destroyed all we had\r\nAll I can hope is that I taste really bad\r\nThey're eating all my friends without shedding a tear\r\nAll in all, it's gonna be a bad year\r\n-ZOMBIE-\r\nNow we're gonna get ya cause we 'bout nearly won\r\nA fancy feast of human meat is what you've become\r\n-HUMAN=\r\nThey're eating all the armies and they're chewing the tanks\r\nOne even stopped and said grace and gave thanks\r\nAnd they're eating at my feet and chomping my body\r\nNow they're at my torso, it's a cannibal party\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nIt's a Zombie \r\nZombie Attack!\r\nIt's a Zombie \r\nZombie Attack!\r\nWhy'd I stay behind?\r\nI should have fled!\r\nNow I'm on the dinner plate\r\nI've fed the undead :-(\r\n\r\nEnd.\r\n\r\nMusic: By

distorted form\r\nOnce their son now clearly something more\r\nLifeless eyes gleaming\r\n\r\nVerse 4\r\n\r\nPraying that the moment?s not too late\r\nThe husband takes one final chance with fate\r\nHe takes paw and wishes to unmake\r\nThis one last blunder\r\n\r\nThe broken door flies open to the cold\r\nThere?s no more frightful visage to behold\r\nJust silence on a dark and stormy road\r\nJust

Also an engineer, who helped a general get his army across a river by diverting half the flow and creating, in effect, two smaller, more easily forded rivers. \r\nLived 624 ?  546 BCE\r\n\r\nHeraclitus - Hair-uh-CLITE-us (although in Modern Greek, more like \"Air-AH-cleet-oos\")\r\n(http:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/cgi-bin\/audio.pl?bixher01.wav=Heraclitus\/ )\r\nBelieved everything was fundamentally made of fire, and everything was constantly in a state of flux. Said you could never step in the same river twice (because the water keeps flowing - only the outline remains the same). He was the king of the Ionians (mostly an honorific title in his lifetime - they were ruled by Persia), but handed the crown to his brother to go off and philosophize. \r\nLived 535 ? 475 BCE\r\n\r\nZeno - ZEE-no \r\n(http:\/\/www.howjsay.com\/index.php?word=zeno)\r\nThere are two Zenos, which is funny because the older Zeno (of Elea) is known for paradoxes based on dividing things into smaller and smaller parts. The younger Zeno (of Citium) is known for founding the Stoic school of dudes who, like, lived in barrels and did without anything they considered unnecessary. The older, paradoxical Zeno died a METAL death... he was arrested for trying to overthrow \"Nearchus the Tyrant\". After being tortured, he said he'd tell the tyrant what he wanted to know, but only by whispering it to him. Nearchus leaned in close and Zeno bit him, not unclenching his jaws \"until he lost his life and the tyrant lost that part of his body,\" according to Valerius Maximus. The body part was either the tyrant's ear or his nose, depending on who you believe. \r\nGet the cosmic joke? The philosopher who kept dividing indivisible things dies biting off a dude's ear? \r\nLived 490 ? 430 BCE (the older) or 335 ? 263 BCE (the younger)\r\n","round":"70","votes":"2","winner":"1","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"1","vocalswin":"1","rating":"0","musicvote":"3","lyricsvote":"4","vocalsvote":"4","teamnumber":"2","submitby":"","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":"0","streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/210530803\/stream"},{"id":"415","name":"The

day\r\nHair messed up, and face apathetic\r\nYou were snide from the start, and it put me off\r\nDidn\u2019t shut you down, and I regret it. \r\nI just wanted to have one last fun time\r\nBut you wanted to be, my sole focus\r\nI walked away, and you threw a fit\r\nThat\u2019s when I knew, there was no more us\r\n\r\nBridge\r\n\r\nOurs was a short romance\r\nWe never stood a

anticipating\r\nCompadre in the whip, but drugs MIA\r\n\r\nHomie phone exhausted, my hookups depleted\r\nMaybe outside the venue, these pills can be received\r\nSet out for the ride, with this liquor loaded in me\r\nParking now paid, time to be out up on the search\r\n\r\nWell it's kind of a deseperate time measure,\r\nSo I figure fuck it, I'll go ahead and speak to this animated cat\r\nHe's tellin' me he's got the dopest shit you can get, this side of the street\r\nSo I slide him the bills required and depart from the corner\r\n\r\nStraight to the gullet, homie wants no part of it\r\nPeculiar, he's usually first to wanna smash\r\nWhen he passes on offer, I double down on intake\r\nSwallow the last pill as I walk through security\r\n\r\n[ill choices -- Verse Three]\r\n\r\nLights wilin' out, bass feeling vibrant\r\nChampion status, walking on an elevated plane\r\nRecognize individual I arrived on the scene with\r\nWe inside, but man I wish he was on this level too\r\n\r\nWe got in at 10:33, so the act had began\r\nAnd then my heart thumps, and the second it was spaced out\r\nFeelings turnin' cold, first my forehead then my arm spasms\r\nTry to shake these feelings, but I know it's not right\r\n\r\nI need some fresh air, so I push to the front entrance\r\nAnd I see the cat who sold me the pills\r\nBut it's wrong, he's lookin' homeless, pant and shirt tattered\r\nTunnel vision, but I swear I saw a toothless fucking

an endless message from edge to edge...\r\nbut the story lies in the spaces between.\r\n\r\n[Verse 1-2]\r\nLong ago in time forgotten\r\nA bet was made, a die was cast\r\nBetween a soldier, freshly fallen\r\nAnd he who claimed his breath, his last\r\n\r\nUpon a slate as blank as nothing\r\nBoth would work what art they could\r\nWithout a plan or path to follow\r\nUnspoken rules still understood\r\n\r\n[combined verse 3 and chorus 1] - switch between vocalists for each line\r\nAnd as their minds were forced together\r\n-Born in the house of the mother and father,\r\nBoth light and sound exploded out\r\n-into the arms of the ever after.\r\nAnd for the first but not the last time\r\n-Woven through universes, our existence.\r\nA universe Nothing spat out\r\n-Waves, light and matter - again and again\r\n\r\n[Verse 4]\r\nFor countless ages they attempted\r\nTo fill the canvas which they\u2019d made\r\nBut even in their endless power\r\nWhat they\u2019d built made them afraid\r\n\r\n[combined verse 5 and chorus 2]\r\nAnd when the planets started living\r\n-Born in the name of the mother and father\r\nThen they knew they\u2019d gone too far\r\n-into the flames of forever and after.\r\nAnd in their own ways sought destruction\r\n-Unstitch the universe for qualified existence\r\nOne through famine, one through war\r\n-waves of hatred consume us, start again\r\n\r\n[Ineterlude (spoken)]\r\nBattle scars stuck out like maps drawn on the faces of fallen soldiers,\r\neach one pointing to a single destination; our last breath.\r\nAn ever clearer view of what we never wanted to be true.\r\nThese were the only answers we ever really knew.\r\nSomething had to change\r\n\r\n[Verse 6-7]\r\nBut the worlds which they\u2019d imagined\r\nHad turned against them stubbornly\r\nThe countless hordes which they\u2019d created\r\nMade it impossible to flee\r\n\r\nAnd two had lost where two had gambled\r\nBrought to their knees by blood and bone\r\nOnce sat atop their thrones of glory\r\nNow into darkness they are sewn\r\n\r\n[Chorus 3-4]\r\nBorn of this time, but of some other place.\r\nAn original question - better clear the slate.\r\nCast a new die - something we can create.\r\nThe search for answers we can simulate.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit of a gamble on a yes-or-no test.\r\nA walk of the plank, this is anyone's guess.\r\nJust one last check. All conditions are set.\r\nWhat will we find in here? Let's make a bet.\r\n\r\n[Outro (spoken)]\r\nLooking out into reality, there lurked something so primal yet so final. It always will, and it dares us to seek it out.\r\nLooking in, however, justifies us, but in ways we will never fully appreciate.\r\nThe heaviest burdens are shifted ever onward.\r\nWe are the burning stars.\r\nWe are noise in an endless message.\r\nOur story lies in the spaces within.","round":"100","votes":"0","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":null,"musicvote":"6","lyricsvote":"3","vocalsvote":"3","teamnumber":"19","submitby":"ElTonerino","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/281264310\/stream"},{"id":"679","name":"YouthSick","url":"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/kenn-21\/youthsick","music":"omegapisquared+Bees","lyrics":"grantimatter+zildjia","vocals":"asiansoundtech+mgoy","lyricsheet":"Music: \/u\/omegapisquared & \/u\/BeesAreFliesWithKniv\r\nLyrics: \/u\/grantimatter & \/u\/zildjian2613\r\nVocals: u\/asiansoundtech & \/u\/mgoyoda\r\n\r\nYouthSick\r\n\r\nV1.

on stairs will kill ya\r\nDon\u2019t agree if the wife wants it anally\r\nShe\u2019s a witch and it will be fatal and\r\nBe sure to store all your juice in a small box\r\nAnd try not to get malaria or smallpox\r\n\r\nFor real - watch out for smallpox it's a very dangerous disease.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\r\nHere I am to show you how to do it\r\nMeasure her insides with your unit\r\nIf you\u2019re frisky

It's a reference to his music used as sports anthems, as well as hardly any new good music around (he could easily score with a new hit).\r\nPluto guards the fourth circle of hell in Dante's inferno. Which is greed. It would be greedy of him to demand another chance at making music.\r\nSo he has to depend on others to make music to honor him, and when he does he can dream again (he references dreaming in songs like A Winter's Tale).\r\n&amp;quot;Some are high some are low&amp;quot; referring to hearing people try to imitate him off key. He's a puppet because he's not in control, neither is anyone watching someone use them as inspiration.\r\nThe chorus basically explains the song, he's watching us and living through us. Is he satisfied? He's stratified (split in a hierarchy of layers).\r\nBut he's still remembered, and magnified.\r\nFlorentines are in the sixth circle of hell which is heresy. Which is really what we are doing.\r\nHe'd like that wall to come down, but can't from where he is.\r\nSome of what we will be doing (maybe all) won't live up to Queen, so he's feeling crucified.\r\nBut he decides to spin it positive, he's dreaming again (as he did lyrically) and drinking from a scarlet cup (in which spring is contained, rebirth).","round":"107","votes":"4","winner":"1","musicwin":"1","lyricswin":"1","vocalswin":"1","rating":null,"musicvote":"7","lyricsvote":"5","vocalsvote":"6","teamnumber":"15","submitby":"pdlourenco","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/297532391\/stream"},{"id":"774","name":"Ratatouille","url":"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/alan-jakeson\/ratatouille","music":"DeadPlatypus","lyrics":"GastricSparrow","vocals":"DeadPlatypus","lyricsheet":"Who could ever belong here\r\nAcquainted with only fear\r\nI can\u2019t even be myself\r\nI can\u2019t be somebody else\r\nOut here, out here\r\n\r\n\r\nI have got high ego\r\nI\u2019ve got dreams and hopes galore\r\nBut I\u2019m stuck here saving lives\r\nI want more\r\nIs this all\r\nAll for me\r\n\r\n\r\nDown here I am praised\r\nBut they\u2019ve never wanted me to read\r\nCareful words against the herd\r\nThey don't want \r\nWant to see\r\nSo will you\r\nTake me away\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find, find the truth\r\nThe truth about everything\r\nIn their best selling books and their emerald rings\r\nBut you won't find, no you won\u2019t find love\r\nWhere the sun don\u2019t shine\r\nIt\u2019s me and only me you\u2019ll find\r\n\r\n\r\nAll alone, my family gone\r\nMy heroes all left me for dead\r\nI have nothing more to live for\r\nOutta my head\r\nSo take me into yours\r\n\r\n\r\nSo they want to pre-package your legacy\r\nBut I had a spy on the inside\r\nFor the dream that you had was fantasy\r\nWill you read, oh will you read\r\nthe obituaries\r\nAnd take me away!~\r\n\r\n\r\nPas gratuit\r\nNothing in life is free\r\nSome say it\u2019s overkill to kill for something like this oh\r\nQuel rat!\r\nMs Golightly\r\nBring out the pitchforks, hacksaws and the torches just to\r\nChange the order\r\nWhere's yours, sir?\r\nBring me the thunderstorms bring me the guns and swords\r\nChange the order\r\nWhere's yours, sir?\r\nIt's for her and him to take the order out and far away~\r\n\r\nWhen you're happy to be stepped on\r\nSomeone else will gladly get it done\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready for the recipe\r\nBuy the spices that you never want\r\n\r\nNo I won't take it off\r\nNo I won't take it away\r\nOh no I won't rat it out\r\nNo I won't hand it to that \/ shadow of the \/ past if all the \/ bad bad meanies \/ are in on it\r\nTake it away\r\nTake me away\r\nWhat more should I say?\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t change the order\r\nWhere's yours, sir?\r\nIt's for her to take it away\r\n\r\nMint and oregano\r\nStay out of trouble\u2019s way\r\nBring the leghold traps\r\nAnd call it a day\r\n\r\nThunderstorm!

she did not depart just yet\u2026 she came right back\u2026 she died in the crash but is still in the two of us I, I swear...\r\n\r\nRemember those two ladies in the beauty salon? Well, they were watching us while their hair was set yes i know i know one had avocado skin and pin curls - no, it was the other one, the one who was blind\u2026she is one who could see\u2026 one with second sight.. she saw the soul right through us and was alarmed oh, no no no we have to leave now... he will notice the blood in the sink. We will stay in Tokyo for the night and leave for San Francisco by morning: carry a coat and fill the pockets with cash and credit cards. Stay near the walls in the house; avoid the mirrors. This world is full of cameras and watchers. Get moving in the shadows now. I will be right back\u2026\r\n\r\nWe wrapped the bodies in towels, oh yes, the folds of darkness helped remove the dead of night. The lotions on their skin, the cucumbers over their eyes, the frizzled hair then submerged in soggy lukewarm water. Each one, we held each elderly woman down, their limbs flailing against the bath walls, trying to keep a mouth open. You began to cry\u2026 you began to cry after the blind woman, she was our nanny when we were kids\u2026 they wanted her dead too. Once the nine were done with, we exited the back entrance, over soggy cardboard boxes and open soap bottles and appeared a narrow alleyway. The midnight chimes of a nearby church jangled away from the heavy traffic as our fake masseuse costumes caught the breeze - our car quietly approached the back entrance. \r\n\r\nWhen we went into the passenger's seat, Kaito grabbed your wrist and began kissing you. While Kaito was undoubtedly a narcissist, he was much kinder to you than Takehiko was to me. As the night dragged on, Takehiko began cursing how relieved he was for his mother to be dead. Even though Takehiko loved his mother and visited her hospital bed every\r\nweek, he returned angrier and angrier at his debt and her constant suffering. Perhaps he did not want her to die?\r\n\r\nAround 11 or so we headed out of Tokyo\u2019s metropolitan district, the tourist traps with neon signs. As Kaito informed the two of us of our next \u2018master\u2019, you began to cry. It was the blind woman on your mind again. Kaito slapped you across your face - the mascara was coming off and it would be harder to sell you. You began to scream. \u201cI want to see the blind woman! Tell me who she was!\u201d \r\n\r\n\u201cStop, Stop, Stop!\u201d Takehiko yelled desperately. In a fit of anger and denial, Takehiko delievered a powerful blow to your head, killing you.","round":"111","votes":"0","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"1","vocalswin":"0","rating":null,"musicvote":"0","lyricsvote":"7","vocalsvote":"5","teamnumber":"7","submitby":"Wachtos","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":null},{"id":"828","name":"Gators

world, but is it too late?\r\nEverywhere I go, one thing is indiscriminate. \r\nHatred for religion, culture and race,\r\nI'm so tired of trying to set the fucking record straight. \r\nSo when I get on the Mic all I want to do is berate.\r\n\r\nVerse 2\r\nThe hate, the pain, the sorrow and confusion. \r\nThe anger, the frustration, the goddamn delusion. \r\nThat the colour of one's skin determines their worth, the illusion\r\nOf power, now real, and for your amusement.\r\nA forced infusion of so called culture, an intrusion. \r\nPeople's beliefs? Fuck that, here's a profusion\r\nOf guns, knives, death and destitution. \r\nIn the name of freedom, please, heed my effusion.\r\n\r\nChorus 1\r\nI make a stand here today. \r\nNo more, is what I say. \r\nListen. Learn. Adapt and change.\r\nLet's make this a world worth living in.\r\nIt's a cruel world, but it'll be okay.\r\nWhat is acceptable always starts as strange.\r\nThe only sin is not standing for what you believe in.\r\n\r\nVerse 3\r\nI used to believe in the good of mankind,\r\nNo matter what, no one would be left behind. \r\nAnd then I grew up, saw the reality and cried\r\nThere's so much violence in this world, why?\r\nI'm tired of the bombs, the horror and the phobia. \r\nAn air of fear controlled by the media. \r\nThe stagnant air of avaritia and acedia\r\nFor the love of everything, hear my plea\r\n\r\nVerse 4\r\nLet the people in, the tired, sick refugees\r\nImpeach the president, let's finally be free\r\nLet humanity shine, and stand for good once more\r\nLet us take from the rich and give to the poor!\r\nLet the people in, the tired, sick refugees\r\nImpeach the president, let's finally be free\r\nLet humanity shine, and stand for good once more\r\nLet us take from the rich and give to the poor!\r\n\r\nChorus 2\r\nI make a stand here today. \r\nNo more, is what I say. \r\nListen.

work from school\r\n\r\nShe sees a tramp, Sitting in the streets\r\nDirty and alone\r\nEyes at his feet\r\n\r\nHe looks up and looks into her eyes\r\nMary gets nervous\r\nAnd looks to the sky\r\n\r\nBut little did she know that\r\nTheir lives would interlock\r\nAnd little did she know\r\nHow much it'd be fucked\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sits in the gutter\r\nEyes at the floor\r\nHis heart is aflutter\r\nThinking of all he can&rsquo;t afford\r\n\r\nEver since she left him, well\r\nHe&rsquo;s become a mess\r\nCan&rsquo;t even afford \r\nFood scraps or less\r\n\r\nHe looks up\r\nTo those who

different\r\nSince he&rsquo;s not around\r\nThe man of her dreams\r\nwas lost, and not found\r\n\r\nHe went to fight in a battle, not his\r\nDied to protect some corporate interests\r\n\r\nShe sees

that's when Jess saw him\r\nAt the end of her bed\r\nHe drew in closer\r\nWhat's going on inside his head?\r\n\r\nShe shook, \r\nCried \r\nand screamed to stay back \r\nHis instincts kicked in \r\nand then he jumped to attack \r\n\r\nMary awoke and called the police \r\nbut it was too late \r\nthe screaming had ceased \r\n\r\nShe knew he was there outside her locked room \r\na feeling arose of impending doom \r\nThen the sirens emerged and silenced her thoughts \r\nThe police surged in, then there was a shot\r\n\r\nNow she knew just how their\r\nLives were interlocked\r\nSo she thanked her mom\r\nFor the sacrifice she got\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a mangy one\r\nNeglected and abused\r\nHis mother left him\r\nShe couldn&rsquo;t afford his food\r\n\r\nNobody cared\r\nNo state, church, or man\r\nHe was just a street mutt\r\nAnd he&rsquo;d been damned\r\n\r\nHe merely wanted to be loved\r\nTo protect and to be fed\r\nBut people feared him\r\nBecause of how he was bred\r\n\r\nHis father was a fighter dog\r\nHis mother was a bitch\r\nHe was merely bred\r\nFor profit\r\n\r\nHe only wanted\r\nTo be found and loved\r\nBut instead he got\r\nThe bullet of a

Calculus III and Charlie needed help\r\nEveryone said &ldquo;to Chloe you should yelp&rdquo;\r\nShe knew the Greek word that &ldquo;physics&rdquo; had come from\r\nBut in the subject itself it could be said she was quite dumb\r\n \r\nShe couldn&rsquo;t refuse, it was on Charlie that she crushed\r\nBut calculus left her brain feeling super mushed\r\nThere was a guy she knew, maybe she could confide in\r\nHis name was Ron, his name was Ron Peart-Skillson\r\n \r\nHe said he&rsquo;d help her help the guy\r\nIf only one favor of his she would oblige\r\nBeing a nerd he only had one demand\r\nHe&rsquo;d help if only she would hold his hand\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Strange&rdquo; she thought but not so out of line\r\nShe said &ldquo;alright then maybe just this one time&rdquo;\r\nAnd so he showed what she needed to show him\r\nAfter he made full-on contact with her limb\r\n\r\nCharlie&rsquo;s grades improved, he was so impressed\r\nWith Chloe he had hopes of passing the coming test\r\nBut maybe she could help him with his Latin\r\nFor her the wrong branch of Indo-European\r\n\r\nBut Ron got a 5 on the AP Latin test\r\nPeritus Latine legendi he was truly blessed\r\n&ldquo;Would you help me again please?&rdquo; so silently she asked\r\n&ldquo;Te adiuvabit; that means &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll help you&rsquo;&rdquo; he did broadcast\r\n\r\nWhenever she needed help there he would be\r\nEver intelligent was he\r\nReady to help for an uncomfortable price\r\nThis time &ldquo;for this, a kiss would be nice&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWith a groan and an eye roll she consented\r\nTo his pathetic demands having been presented\r\nAgain Charlie did well and Chloe was glad\r\nHer chances with him were not half bad\r\n\r\nBut then it was that he had a test\r\nOn yet another subject not her best\r\nAnd again to Ron she asked for assistance\r\nBut his great demand was the horizontal dance\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hell to the no!&rdquo; she said,\r\nNot out loud but in her mind &ldquo;I'd rather be dead&rdquo;\r\nBut he pressed her and finally got a deal\r\n&ldquo;If Charlie passes, which he will, you must figure what I feel&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You must guess and guess which fetish is my favorite&rdquo;\r\nShe agreed, for knowledge she had a bit\r\nDays before she had seen him close a folder\r\nIt was femdom she saw from above his shoulder\r\n\r\nSo when Charlie had passed the exam\r\nHe told Chloe &ldquo;oh my God thank you fam&rdquo;\r\nSo she went off to find Ron\r\nAnd tell him what it was that turned him on\r\n\r\nRon was ready for this to go on long\r\nLittle did he know he was so wrong\r\n&ldquo;Femdom,&rdquo; she said with no trepidation\r\n&ldquo;That's what helps you with your&hellip; uh... self celebration&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe wanted to draw this out, he was so confused\r\nRuined he was like the men in his videos, abused\r\n&ldquo;How am I supposed to enjoy this?\r\nCouldn't you try to start guessing with piss?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSo she chewed him out to hell,\r\nMaybe it'd get him off well\r\nYelled and yelled at him she did\r\nBut he ran away and hid\r\n\r\nBecause that idiot took it literally.","round":"123","votes":"4","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":null,"musicvote":"8","lyricsvote":"5","vocalsvote":"5","teamnumber":"7","submitby":"E-B-Gb-Ab-Bb","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/337543973\/stream"},{"id":"1006","name":"Pendragon

too.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What you reap when you sail with me will be just what you sow,\r\n&ldquo;Respect each other and you will see that respect for us all will grow&rdquo;\r\nRefrain: So it&rsquo;s

the Queen and became our ticket home\r\nPardoned for our piracy, once more on solid ground\r\n&lsquo;Twas no surprise as I looked around that LaRue could not be found.\r\nRefrain: So it&rsquo;s heave

Barbarossa will raise a boisterous toast\r\nBut the pirates who got out alive really are quite few\r\nAnd there&rsquo;s none so rich in heart or gold as them what sailed with LaRue.\r\nRefrain: So

OF THE LIVING SLED\r\n\r\nIn the dark night of christmas\r\nthe stockings were hung\r\ngifts were promised us\r\nAnd the hymns were all sung\r\n\r\nThe fire was roaring\r\nthe shades were all drawn\r\nKids asleep, snoring\r\nThe guests were all gone\r\n\r\nToy blocks set as castles\r\npillow forts they had made\r\nCan't compare to the hassles\r\nof building wood barricades\r\n\r\nStringing barbed wire\r\nwhere the lights should have been\r\nto prepare for the slaughter\r\nThe reindeer could bring in\r\n\r\nAfter Santa was shot down\r\nIn dark North Korea\r\nHe arose from that sad ground\r\nUndead with ideas\r\n\r\nHe would now mete out vengeance\r\nwhere he used to give toys\r\nThe world will pay penance\r\nHe'll kill girls and eat boys\r\n\r\nWith 10 elven demons\r\nRiding along on the sleigh\r\nDeath dealing heathens\r\nSmelled of blood and decay\r\n\r\nThe reindeer all had red noses\r\nBut so were their eyes\r\nAnyone who opposes\r\nWould be eaten alive\r\n\r\nSo I stood by the window\r\nShotgun in my hand\r\nLooking above and below\r\nA possible last stand\r\n\r\nMy gloves were all worn thin\r\nFrom nailing wood beams\r\nThen in the distance I heard them \r\nJanging bells and dark screams\r\n\r\nI branced for the impact\r\na sliegh hitting the roof\r\nI heard heavy hooves, footsteps\r\nThe moment of truth\r\n\r\nThey can't use the chimney\r\nWith the fire below\r\nBut I looked forward grimly\r\nto face this night in the snow\r\n\r\nHO HO Zombie Santa\r\nHe jumped all the way down\r\nSlugged 3 shots of mylanta\r\nTime to take out this clown\r\n\r\nMy wife had the flamethrower\r\nAnd was ready to burn\r\nBut we gagged at the odor\r\nof St Nick's foul return\r\n\r\nThe raindeer barked and bit hard\r\non the wood from the door\r\nThe elves caught us off guard\r\nby coming up through the floor\r\n\r\nSo I used a sledgehammer\r\nVery lively and quick\r\nThere isn't much glamor\r\nSmashing elves of St. Nick\r\n\r\nWe shot through the mail slot\r\nA death dealing game\r\nAnd as they melted and got shot\r\nWe laughed and called them by name\r\n\r\nDie dasher\r\nDie dancer\r\nDie prancer\r\nBurn vixen\r\nMelt comet\r\nOn cupid\r\nYou can donder\r\nOur blitzen\r\n\r\nI shot off Santa's hat\r\nMy wife burned his belly\r\nReloaded my gat\r\nWhile she turned him to jelly\r\n\r\nWith napalm death\r\nBeing shot from the barrel\r\nOur hot smoking breath\r\nChanted no christmas carols\r\n\r\nAnd then with a bray and yell\r\nI heard on the roof\r\nas Rudolph fled back to hell\r\nI shot at his hooves\r\n\r\nBut I think that I hit him\r\nAs he flew out of sight\r\nAnd so it was written \r\nWhat a damned christmas

dream\r\n\r\nHe wasn't cursed, you understand\r\nWas not a prince disguised\r\nYet loved the Princess of the land\r\nWho sought love far and wide\r\n\r\nHe courted with her courters,\r\nWoo'd with wet advances\r\nWhich was allowed, by order\r\nShe believed in equal chances\r\n\r\nBut then, reader, she was betrothed\r\nTo the poor frog's dismay\r\nA suitor royal, human, clothed\r\nSuited in every way\r\n\r\nBut the nobleman was cold\r\nHe wanted the doting frog dead\r\nHe vowed to eat it whole\r\nWhen he found frog prints in her bed\r\n\r\nHave you ever been told you've got a frog in your throat?\r\nYou don't\r\nCause that frog inside would puff up wide and croak\r\nTil you choked\r\n\r\nThe Nobleman died when he tried to eat the frog alive\r\nAs the main course on their wedding night\r\n\r\nThe hero survived, the villain croaked\r\nThe frog pushed his way out of his throat\r\nOnto the princess's plate, for their first dinner date\r\nBy then their love lived, by choice or by fate\r\n \r\nIt's vital that a princess knows what her Prince is made of\r\nIt's not the height or the clothes, but that he's filled with true love\r\nAnd if he doesn't transform after they kiss\r\nHe'll still be a prince, because she says he is\r\n","round":"139","votes":"1","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"1","vocalswin":"0","rating":null,"musicvote":"7","lyricsvote":"7","vocalsvote":"2","teamnumber":"2","submitby":"specocean","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/423097884\/stream"},{"id":"1211","name":"Croaking

HARSHA\r\n\r\nHarshavardhana, also known as Harsha, was an Indian emperor who ruled over a large empire in northern India from 606 to 647. The second son of Prabhakarvardhana, he hailed from the Pushyabhuti Dynasty. After the death of his father, his elder brother Rajyavardhana took over the reins of the kingdom. However, Rajyavardhana too died, most probably killed by Shashanka, the ruler of the Gauda kingdom following which the young Harsha came to power. After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century, Northern India had fallen apart to small republics and minor states. After ascending the throne Harsha united the small republics from Punjab to central India, to create a vast unified empire. Under his rule, the empire underwent considerable expansion and grew to include the Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bengal, Odisha and the entire Indo-Gangetic plain north of the Narmada River. He proved himself to be an able administrator and presided over a kingdom where peace and prosperity prevailed for most of the time. He had an intellectual bent of mind and his court was a hub of artistic activities. Harsha himself was a Mahayana Buddhist and was tolerant towards all Indic faiths.\r\n\r\nBorn in India, 2nd son to the king\r\nThe year was 590, sister and brother\r\nThe King died - his elder brother succeeding\r\nBut the Malava dominion made everyone suffer\r\n\r\nHarshavardhana's sister Rajyashri\r\nwas kidnapped and her husband slaughtered\r\nMalava fell under the King Brother's Blitzkrieg\r\nEnemy was destroyed by marauders\r\n\r\nBut Brother Rajyavardhana was killed\r\nBetrayed by a ruler he thought was a friend\r\nIn 606 Harsha's destiny becomes fulfilled\r\nAt age 16 to the crown he ascends\r\n\r\nThe first thing he does is promise revenge\r\nInherited his brother-in-law's city\r\nBut his family deaths have to be avenged\r\nFor the backstabber Shashanka no pity\r\n\r\nRescued his sister by a forceful attack\r\nbut the enemy somehow survived\r\nHarsha added regions as cities were sacked\r\nBut Shashanka still remained alive\r\n\r\nPunjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Bengal\r\nwere added to the regions he reigned\r\nOdisha and Northern India all were assailed\r\nAdded them to the cities he gained\r\n\r\nBut to the people he ruled he was good\r\nBenevelent prosperous and fair\r\nThe economy swelled and he helped where he could\r\nFor the underprivleged and poor he did care\r\n\r\nBut he could not defeat the the southern traitor\r\nAnd trade business dropped which was alarming\r\nHe thought how to make his kingdom greater\r\nSo he moved its main focus to farming\r\n\r\nWith Emperor Taizong, Tang Dynasty made friends\r\nNeeded more allies to make power wider\r\nAnd to his country he contined to tend\r\nMade the 1st diplomatic relations with China\r\n\r\nMade a giant university as a walled fort\r\nPromoted learning, literature and arts\r\nAllowed religious diversity in his court\r\nBut hated Shashanka in his heart\r\n\r\nConverted to Buddhism from Hindu\r\nAnd even wrote 3 plays of his own\r\nIn the last one the two religions were merged into\r\nHis giant religious gathering, it still goes\r\n\r\nWith his wife Durgavati, had 2 sons\r\nThey'd inherit the world that he built\r\nBut all of his plans came undone\r\nHis chief minister had his sons killed\r\n\r\nAnd he tried again to win war in the South\r\nAnd lost again to the kings that he hated\r\nRevenge he'd have to go without\r\nFrom his high point his glory was faded\r\n\r\nSo he sat alone on his throne in the North\r\nEmpty hall full of treasure and maps\r\nNothing mattered anymore on this earth\r\nAnd when he died his whole kingdom collaped.","round":"141","votes":"1","winner":"0","musicwin":"1","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":null,"musicvote":"8","lyricsvote":"5","vocalsvote":"5","teamnumber":"2","submitby":"ExternalInfluence","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/436928175\/stream"},{"id":"1226","name":"The

takeoff\r\nWhen Rudolph awoke.\r\nHe heard the sleigh loading\r\nBut the lock, it was broke.\r\n\r\nThe barn door to his bedroom\r\nWas soundly locked shut\r\nHe yelled and he pounded\r\nHis hooves scraped, getting cut\r\n\r\nHe started to panic \r\nAs he heard them tying gifts down\r\nHow could they leave here without him?\r\nDon't they hear him yell, hear him pound?\r\n\r\nHe heard them ready for takeoff\r\nAnd a deeper dread, it set in\r\nThen he heard someone say \"Onward!\" -\r\nAnd it sounded like him?\r\n\r\nSo he backed up to the rear wall\r\nAnd rushed towards the door.\r\nThe force of it smashing\r\nThe barn's wood to the floor!\r\n\r\nPanting he emerged,\r\nThe sleigh team turned to him scared\r\nFor the very first time ever,\r\nThe truth, it was bared :\r\n\r\nAt the front of the team\r\nLeading Santa and elves\r\nWas a reindeer with a red nose;\r\nYounger version of himself.\r\n\r\nHyaah! (Whip crack) The sleigh launched with a great HoHoHo\r\nAnd stunned, confused Rudolph\r\nStood alone in the snow.\r\n\r\nHe stood there for hours\r\nTrying to figure it\r\nFloorplan of the North Pole\r\nTheir prepatory route..?\r\n\r\nThen he remembered the workshop,\r\nIn the back a small door.\r\nHe was told never to look there\r\nNot allowed to ask what it's for\r\n\r\nSo there he went promptly\r\nThe empty shop was now bare\r\nThe door it was padlocked,\r\nAnd he angrily stared\r\n\r\nThen with a wail and a great heave\r\nHis hooves smashed off the lock\r\nAnd what he saw through there\r\nIt made his jaw drop\r\n\r\nA medical laboratory\r\nWith tubes, bottles,and guages\r\nAnd he saw versions of himself\r\nAt various ages.\r\n\r\nLined up there sleeping a baby, teenager, and one of him old.\r\nDying in a bedside,\r\nShivering cold.\r\n\r\nHe knelt by the bedside\r\nThe old reindeer looked on:\r\n\"You weren't supposed to see this\r\nNo one was to let on.\"\r\n\r\nBut then he looked sideways\r\nAnd saw a room next to this\r\n\"No!\", Yelled old Rudolph\r\nBut he could not resist\r\n\r\nAnd then Rudolph saw\r\nThat he wasn't alone...\r\nThere were young and old Santas,\r\nAll of them clones.\r\n\r\n\"No one lives forever,\r\nEven Jolly St Nick.\",\r\nDid say the old Rudolph,\r\nCoughing, so sick.\r\n\r\nAnd in that room was a trap door\r\nWhich Rudolph then flipped\r\nAnd he went down the stairway\r\nAnd into a crypt\r\n\r\nGoing back centuries\r\nA hall with thousands of tombs\r\nAnd realized the eternity\r\nOf their endless task doom\r\n\r\nFor what brought joy to millions\r\nNow he found the proof\r\nA Sysiphisian Nightmare\r\nHe cried at the truth\r\n\r\nSlaves here forever\r\nHe saw it firsthand\r\nThe presents of Christmas\r\nwere produced by the Damned\r\n","round":"158","votes":"0","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":null,"musicvote":"0","lyricsvote":"0","vocalsvote":"0","teamnumber":"58","submitby":"","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/552757662\/stream"},{"id":"1338","name":"Resolutions","url":"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/fistmissile\/resolutoretooled-1","music":"ShoulderCannon","lyrics":"drewbixt","vocals":"drewbixt","lyricsheet":"Sing

LIFE\r\n--------------------------\r\n(Guitars by Scott Pontiac)\r\n\r\nPARTS OF MY LIFE\r\n----------------\r\nCHILDHOOD\r\n\r\nWhen I was young , the world was wide open\r\nJust having fun, Playing and joking\r\nHow could I know about teenage angst\r\nWhy would I care about giving thanks\r\nLive for the moment, no reason to plan\r\nIt\u2019s all just enjoyment, before becoming a man\r\nTaking for granted the freedom I had \r\nEnjoying the good, not knowing the bad\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\r\nWhich parts of my life are considered the best?\r\nThe one without strife, who would have have guessed,\r\nHad it so good, but now it\u2019s all changed\r\nMaybe I should just try and arrange\r\nThe parts of my life that I want to keep\r\nGet rid of the times that prevent me from sleep!\r\n\r\nTEEN YEARS\r\n\r\nStruggle through high school, getting in fights\r\nDrinking and partying all through the night\r\nSo stuck in my head, that I can\u2019t look up\r\nNot planning, instead, just try to hook up\r\nHow could I care about money and work \r\nWhy would I dare to be planned and alert?\r\nTaking for granted the freedom I had \r\nEnjoying the good, not knowing the bad\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\r\nWhich parts of my life are considered the best\r\nIt\u2019s hard to decide, when viewing the rest,\r\nHad it so great, but now it\u2019s all changed\r\nMaybe I should have acted more strange\r\nWhat parts of my life do I want to stay \r\nGet rid of the times I was alone and afraid\r\n\r\nADULT YEARS\r\n\r\nNow I am working, providing for things\r\nEarning the money and all that it brings,\r\nStuck in a pattern, not realizing the time\r\nI was spending  forever, just standing in line \r\nPunching the clock, awaiting my turn\r\nBut how much cash do I need to earn \r\nTo sell away all of the freedom I had \r\nForgetting the good so I can pay for the sad\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\r\nWhich parts of my life are considered the best\r\nI know it\u2019s not when I was most stressed\r\nHad it so great, but now it\u2019s all changed\r\nMy time for the money is what I exchanged\r\nWhat parts of my life do I want to remain \r\nGet rid of the times I was exhausted and strained \r\n\r\nELDER YEARS\r\n\r\nNow I am old, and I have to look back\r\nWas all of my time spent on the right track \r\nNow death is closer, the end\u2019s drawing near\r\nAll I can do is look back on the years\r\nWhat did I make of the world that I had \r\nI did make a family, now a granddad\r\nI think it\u2019s the children that mean most for my life\r\nThey will outlast me, my marriage an wife\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\r\nWhich parts of my life are considered the best\r\nIt\u2019s hard for me now, now that I\u2019m pressed \r\nHad it so great, but now it\u2019s old age\r\nThe book of life\u2019s ending, no turning the page\r\nWhat parts of my life do I want to recall \r\nI think that I want to remember it all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[All parts were recorded in time but track was never

my old life is gone\r\n\r\nSOLO\r\n\r\nVERSE\r\nForce myself up, bed is empty, I drove her\r\nThe vision's abrupt, blurred by a hangover\r\nShower alone, wash away all of my hope\r\nA new milestone, but I'll learn how to cope\r\n\r\nPRECHORUS\r\nBye, goodbye to the long days of sorrow\r\nBye, goodbye to a long sad tomorrow\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nNow that you're gone, I'm moving on\r\nListening to songs, reflecting upon\r\nHow I'll be strong, and looking beyond\r\nTo another day's dawn, after my old life is gone\r\n\r\nSOLO\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nFutures' uncertain, depending upon,\r\nHow much of the hurting, I let get me down\r\nOpen the curtain, the sun's shining on\r\nMy face in the dawn, after my old life is gone\r\nBye, goodbye to the life that I knew\r\nBye, goodbye to what you put me through\r\nBye, goodbye to the nighttimes with you\r\nBye, goodbye to us, and long overdue\r\n(Fade out)\r\n","round":"177","votes":"3","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":null,"musicvote":"8","lyricsvote":"6","vocalsvote":"6","teamnumber":"22","submitby":"scottpontiac","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/688890304\/stream"},{"id":"1458","name":"When

day\r\n\r\nBut I do say to thee\r\nThat the kingdom they'll lead\r\nWhen you two are both dead and gone\r\nShall be prosperous and free\r\nMore remembered than thee\r\nAnd their kingdom shall be

would never come to be\r\n\r\nBut the boy and the girl\r\nHad dreams of a world\r\nThat one day they would both act upon\r\nBut for now, they'd pretend\r\nAnd play games with their friends\r\n'Bout a

imagined\r\nAnd before too long they encountered a dragon\r\n\r\nAnd it searched through their souls\r\nAnd to this day it's told\r\nThat their spirits were bright like the sun\r\nAnd without a

out the happiest cheers from their mouths\r\nThe boy ruled the north and the girl ruled the south\r\n\r\nThe boy and girl, they grew\r\nAnd found others to choose\r\nAs spouses to, thrones, sit upon\r\nThe kingdom had two kings\r\nAnd two queens to rule things\r\nAnd this kingdom was called Lovalon\r\n\r\n(Verse 5)\r\nSo the kingdom grew in numbers and land\r\nAnd life in the kingdom grew evermore grand\r\nThe people were happy and enjoyed living life\r\nWhile the neighboring kingdom lived in strife\r\n\r\nAnd the rulers who had\r\nMade a mistake so bad \r\nAs to let their kids found Lovalon\r\nDeclared war on their kids\r\nWithout knowing, they did\r\nUnlock the rage of their citizens\r\n\r\n(Verse 6)\r\nThe people overthrew the parents of the kids\r\nWho were now grown up rulers of a kingdom that did\r\nReplace the old kingdom in the people's hearts\r\nAnd a treaty was signed and the treaty did chart\r\n\r\nThe merger of the lands\r\nA celebration grand\r\nMarked the start of

tale of Sir Percival of Wales\r\n\r\nHow he faced the hordes of hell in searching for the holy grail\r\n\r\nThere he saw the dragon's maw Where great flames did soar and swell\r\n\r\nOn his return succumbed to burns, his spirit heard the clarion's bell\r\n\r\nSleep now, Percival, you've shown your honour true\r\nWeep for Percival, he did this all for you\r\nKeep brave Percival within your prayers at night\r\nSleep, dear Percival, and bask in Heaven's light\r\n\r\nVerse\r\n\r\nFrom where I go I may not return\r\n\r\nFewer and fewer flowers and ferns\r\nI left my steed for he would not

depths of the dead\r\n\r\n|spoken, multiple voices|\r\nNow, young Percival, ignore your clammy skin\r\n\r\nSpeak, good Percival, approach Leviathan\r\n\r\nVerse 2\r\n\r\nO great Leviathan, I hope I find you well\r\nI come to find your den within the depths of Hell\r\nMy snowy mail is red from rust and blood of foes\r\nAs I converse with you I'll take a brief repose\r\n\r\nO Noble wyrm I have sought you for but one thing\r\nI seek the wooden grail that rests beneath your wing\r\nGrant me this boon and I will come and go in peace\r\nBut I shall stay until this treasure is released\r\n\r\nChorus\r\n\r\nAnd now the beast has bared its scorching teeth\r\nIn this inferno is my sword pulled from its sheath\r\nI plunge my blade twixt scales to reach its wretched heart\r\nAs flames engulf me this vile foe is torn apart\r\n\r\nBridge\r\n\r\nFly now, Percival, with grail beneath your wing\r\nCry out, Percival, and let your weak voice ring\r\nYearn, late Percival, for those you've left behind\r\nBurn, great Percival, their image in your mind\r\n\r\nThough my flesh screams I still now have a greater goal\r\nFor in my dreams I will save my beloved's soul\r\nTil this is done I challenge Death to do his best\r\nWhile pluck remains with me no more, dear, shall I rest\r\n\r\nAnd as I see the ramparts rise my hold is weak\r\nAnd I allow myself to join among the meek\r\nAnd as I die, I know, I do not die in vain\r\nNow come, sad clarion, and play that sweet refrain","round":"189","votes":"1","winner":"0","musicwin":"0","lyricswin":"0","vocalswin":"0","rating":null,"musicvote":"2","lyricsvote":"4","vocalsvote":"2","teamnumber":"2","submitby":"pfeifits","approved":"1","posted":"0","vocals_agrees":"0","lyrics_agrees":"0","music_agrees":"0","completed_commercial_terms":"0","on_our_sc":null,"streamurl":"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/777085468\/stream"},{"id":"1573","name":"Killing

ground\r\nHorseshoes scattered &lsquo;round her feet\r\nI watched from my bed as she spread them around\r\nAnd picked one up off the street\r\n\r\nI know that these times can get to you\r\nBut I didn&rsquo;t think this\r\nI&rsquo;ve been locked up in my room\r\nWhile everything else is lawless\r\n\r\nAnd how those discs shine as they fly\r\nBreaking the restaurant windows\r\nHer face cramps with her agonized cries\r\nI guess we&rsquo;ve all been locked up for most of our lives\r\n\r\nThe show window glass shines bright on the road\r\nA mosaic of all that we feel\r\nKnowing full well that we&rsquo;re all stuck up in these holes\r\nAlone amidst the
